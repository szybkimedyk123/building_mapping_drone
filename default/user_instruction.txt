**Hi, welcome to our application**

Click on 'Set input file path', to choose a directory containing images that you want to proceed with.
Click on 'Set output file path' and then choose the directory in which point the cloud and mesh object will be stored.

In options, you have various things to customize. 
First thing is 'Max resolution', meaning that images will be scaled to this resolution.
After that is 'Estimate roi', in which you can choose between options: 0 - do not estimate ROI, 1 - estimate ROI and 2 - adaptive estimating ROI
The next option is 'Verbosity' and you can choose from 0 to 4.
If you want to remove depthmaps after processing images, check the next option.
Next section is about meshing.
You can choose an option, if you want to integrate only points inside the ROI.
The next option is the decimation factor, from range 0 to 1, that will be applied to the reconstructed surface.
You can also choose how many iterations the program will do to smooth mesh object.
There is also the option to choose the minimum distance in pixels between the projection of two 3D points to consider them different while making mesh.
The last one is changing the export type between ply or obj.
If you choose to apply, changes will happen, otherwise changes will be discarded.
To start an operation, you have to define input and output paths.
Two buttons with the word 'Show' will open point cloud and mesh respectively. If the program is already finished, there will be your files, otherwise you can choose between default.
