# Building mapping drone (BMD)

## ðŸ“‘ Design Assumptions
The goal of the project is to prepare an app that allows users to load images of a building, based on them, the program should return a 3D object.

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack
1. **Python**
   - OpenCV 
   - Open3D
   - OpenSfM
   - OpenMVG
   - OpenMVS
   - PySide2
   - markdown2
2. **Meshroom**
3. **DJI Mini 2**

## ðŸ’¡ Final Requirements
- Software allowing to create 3D meshed/(point cloud) object(s) of a building with surroundings without texture from multiple aerial pictures (on different heights) of it
- Program should allow user to generate a model without any knowledge of the topic
- Images that will be used in operation should not require preprocessing
- Create instruction for user with guidelines
- GUI - load images, open file with meshed 3D object
- Prepare examples of pictures and visualized building
- Images for processing needs to be manually collected by the drone operator using provided instructions
